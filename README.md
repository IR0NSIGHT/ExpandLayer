# Instructions

## IMPORTANT: SAVE YOUR WORLD BEFORE RUNNING! THIS SCRIPT CAN CRASH WORLDPAINTER AND YOU LOOSE ALL UNSAVED CONTENT!

1. download the newest release as a zip file puddler.js file
2. unpack the zip folder somewhere
3. mark all the spots where rivers can start in your worldpainter world with the CYAN annotation layer. Be generous, a
   100x100 area is fine
4. in WorldPainter, on the top toolbar, center-right, open "run script" and select ExpandLayer_v?_?_?.js from the folder where you
   unpacked the zip file
5. Select your wanted parameters and run the script. Orange annotation will generate around the cyan annotations.

# Known issues
There used to be a performance bug that caused the script to get stuck indefinetly and would cause a force quit of WP.
Bug has been fixed, but if you encounter any issues, please report them on the github page.
